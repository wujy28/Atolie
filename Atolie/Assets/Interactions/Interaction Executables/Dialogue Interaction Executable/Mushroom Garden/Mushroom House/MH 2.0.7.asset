    - Hush now, little Iro.
    - What I want you to do is rather simple.
    - I want you to bring this place back to life.
    - See those mushroom beds back there? I want you to fertilize and water them.
    - Oh, those poor little fungi have been parched and starving all these years!
    - And those enoki mushrooms weeds you see in the pond?
    - 'I want you to remove those parasites. '
    - That's all I ask of you, Iro.
    - Do as I say, and you shall return home.
