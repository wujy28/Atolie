    - "Hmm\u2026"
    - The old shroom grandpa said that he placed the shears somewhere around here.
    - Wait a minute...
    - "There\u2019s something shiny down there..."
    - "Oh... Don\u2019t tell me\u2026"
    - "That\u2019s the shears, isn\u2019t it."
    - But my stubby arms are too short to reach it!
    - Is there anything I can use to reach the bottom of the pond?
